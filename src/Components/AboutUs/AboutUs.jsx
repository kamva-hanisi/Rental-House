    Whispers of the Ocean

    The ocean sings a lullaby,
    Beneath the vast and endless sky.
    A melody of whispered waves,
    That dance through time, in echoing caves.

    Its waters gleam in golden light,
    As dawn ignites the edge of night.
    And with each tide, it breathes anew,
    A rhythm ancient, deep, and true.

    The waves embrace the rugged shore,
    A fleeting kiss, then touch no more.
    Yet in their pull, a promise stays,
    To always find a thousand ways.
